# CQRS Base Architecture



## Project Description

CQRS (Command Query Responsibility Segregation) is a software architectural pattern that separates the read and write operations of a system into distinct parts. The CQRS Base Architecture project provides a foundation for building CQRS-based applications, making it easier to implement and scale complex systems that require a clear separation of concerns.

This project offers a set of essential components and best practices for developing CQRS applications, including command handlers, query handlers, event sourcing, and event-driven architecture. By using this base architecture, developers can focus on building domain-specific functionality while adhering to CQRS principles.

**Key Features**:
- Command and Query Handlers: Easily define and implement command and query handlers for your application's use cases.
- Event Sourcing: Implement event sourcing to maintain a reliable history of state changes.
- Event-Driven Architecture: Leverage the power of events for decoupled, scalable, and reactive systems.
- Scalable and Maintainable: Encourage clean code and maintainability while ensuring scalability.
- Customizable and Extensible: Adapt the base architecture to your project's specific requirements.

**Identity Features**:
- **Roles and Permissions**: Manage user roles and permissions to control access to various parts of your application.
- **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)**: Implement JWT authentication for secure user authentication and authorization.
- **Refresh Tokens**: Enhance security by implementing refresh tokens for extended user sessions.

**Database Integration**:
- **PostgreSQL and Entity Framework**: Utilize PostgreSQL as the database backend, and Entity Framework for data access and manipulation.

**Database Connection**:
- To set up the database connection, edit the `appsettings.json` file and configure the PostgreSQL connection string

**Build and Run**:
- requirements
   - .NET 5.
   - Visual studio 2019 +
   - PostgreSQL 15 +

**Key Library**: This project utilizes the [MediatR library](https://github.com/jbogard/MediatR), a powerful library for implementing the Mediator pattern in C# applications, to simplify command and query handling.

## Getting Started

To get started with the CQRS Base Architecture, follow these steps:

1. **Installation:** Clone this repository to your local environment.

2. **Configuration:** Customize the architecture to your project's requirements, including defining your domain-specific commands, queries, and events. You can utilize the MediatR library for handling commands and queries efficiently.

3. **Implementation:** Build your application's command and query handlers using the provided architecture components and MediatR.

4. **Testing:** Thoroughly test your implementation to ensure that it adheres to the CQRS principles and identity features.

5. **Deployment:** Deploy your CQRS-based application in your chosen environment.
